Please consider using [rocker/tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/) instead.  

We now have a [tidyverse package on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse), and Hadley has been pretty clear with his [objections to the name 'hadleyverse'](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/774008060549312512). The revised tidyverse image is also smaller, versioned, and more stable. 

This image is preserved primarily for historical reasons, though it now builds from `tidyverse` to remain compatibility with it's original setup.
